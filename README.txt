Introduction to the HHL Algorithm and its Use Cases

The HHL algorithm is a quantum algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations, specifically of the form Ax = b. It was developed by Aram Harrow, Avinatan Hassidim, and Seth Lloyd in 2009. The HHL algorithm is expected to provide a speedup over classical methods for solving certain types of linear systems.

One potential application of the HHL algorithm is in the field of machine learning, where linear systems often arise in the form of linear regression problems. The HHL algorithm could potentially be used to speed up the training of certain machine learning models.

Demonstration of the Implemented Algorithm

Now, let's see the HHL algorithm in action. We have a linear system of equations with matrix A and right-hand side vector b:


A = np.array([[3, 1], [1, 2]])
b = np.array([1, 0])
We want to solve this system using the HHL algorithm. We also need to specify a time evolution parameter t and the number of qubits M used to represent the solution:

t = 0.5
M = 2


We can now create an instance of the HHLAlgorithm class and call the solve method to get the solution:

hhl = HHLAlgorithm(A, b, t, M)
x = hhl.solve()
And finally, we can print the solution to the console:


print('The solution to Ax = b is:', x)

Here are the steps that the code follows to solve the linear system Ax = b using the HHL algorithm:

Initialize the HHLAlgorithm object with the input matrix A, the right-hand side vector b, the time evolution parameter t, and the number of qubits M used to represent the solution:

def __init__(self, A, b, t, M):
    self.A = A
    self.b = b
    self.t = t
    self.M = M
Construct the required matrices for the HHL algorithm. These include the identity matrix I, the Hadamard matrix H, and the matrix U, which is defined as U = (I ⊗ H) * exp(2πitA) * (I ⊗ H):


n = len(self.b)
I = np.eye(n)
H = np.array([[1, 1], [1, -1]]) / np.sqrt(2)
U = np.kron(I, H) @ np.kron(expm(1j * 2 * np.pi * self.t * self.A), I) @ np.kron(I, H)

Calculate the solution to Ax = b by applying the matrix U to the initial state |ψ_b⟩ = (b/||b||)|0⟩, where ||b|| is the Euclidean norm of b. The solution x is then obtained by measuring the first M qubits of the resulting state:

psi_b = np.zeros(2 * n)
psi_b[:n] = self.b / np.linalg.norm(self.b)
psi_b = U @ psi_b
psi_b = psi_b / np.linalg.norm(psi_b)
x = np.real(psi_b[:n] @ psi_b[:n])

Return the solution x:

        return x
